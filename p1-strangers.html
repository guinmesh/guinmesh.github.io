      <p>
        Instruction sets for strangers is a project that seeks to connect strangers through a shared task, interaction, or form of curiosity. We were prompted to choose a space that was close to our respective living spaces (but was <strong>not</strong> a part of the New School) and begin to understand it. In order to serve the space and its occupants best, it is necessary to understand the space's historical significance, its unique elements, and how it exists in the present.
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked with Pepper Xiao (Parsons MFA DT '23) and Duo Xu (Parsons MFA DT '23) to create an interactive piece for strangers in <strong>Washington Square Park</strong>., which is located in Greenwich Village, NYC. 
      <h3>
        guiding questions
      </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>What kinds of patterns arise from your observations?</li>
        <li>What kind of narrative does the space suggest?</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        During the week of Sep 30, 2021, we all separately visited Washington Square Park to make our own observations. Pepper and I also visited the site together on Labor Day (Sep 6, 2021). We used several design tools to begin understanding the space better: we completed (1) behavior mapping, (2) AEIOU charts, (3) photo journaling, and (4) brainstorming trees throughout our preliminary research stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several key characteristics of the park. The park is very close to several universities, so there are many students from the New School, New York University, Baruch College, among other institutions. Because of this, there are many young visitors to the park. The park is also frequently filled with people; it is a popular destination that is rarely empty. Because of the number of people, there are also many vendors throughout the park. These vendors sell different items, ranging from drinks, to artwork, to clothing, to drugs, to food.

      <h3>
        the aeiou chart
      </h3>
      <p>
        By tracking and observing the Activities, Environment, Interactions, Objects, and Users (AEIOU) of Washington Square Park, we were able to identify common trends and patterns. How is the space used? Who are the participants?

        After making initial observations, we came back together to collaborate on a concept for the project.

      <p>
        Bubble machines... installed with ladders? Speaker, soothing music. The wind takes the bubbles through the park. If the bubble button is pressed at the same time, can we trigger music? To where? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Also includes ideas for a button taped to a bench (which might be more accessible) and a button hanging from the tree where the machines are located.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remaining questions:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>How does childlike curiosity impact us? Is there a specific time and place for it?</li>
        <li>What are the limitations of the tools we have? Is this design even possible? And if not, would it be possible to create <i>manual</i> bubble makers for people to interact with?</li>
        <li>Whose space are we infringing upon? Can we still respect the boundaries (even if subtle) between public and private space?</li>
        <li>What exactly will this concept call attention to (e.g., natural elements, trees, certain locations, etc.)? Are there any unintended consequences of this design?</li>
        <li>How much does "going viral" or "creating for the photo op" influence our design? How much should it?</li>
      </ol>
