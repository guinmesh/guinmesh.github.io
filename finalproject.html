        This page documents the final product of our interaction design studio. We were prompted to come up with our own areas of interest; once we had clarity in terms of this, we precipitated out specific research questions to explore further.

      <p>
        I have been meditating on grief, in both a global and personal sense. Recently, there have been many sources of grief and loneliness; last year, we saw the beginnings of the COVID-19 pandemic (within the US, it took over in March 2020) as well as manifestations of climate change and climate crisis. I have also lost close family members and friends over the past year. All of these events have contributed to my interest in manifestations of grief at different scales.
      </p>
     
      <p>
        Plant life and botany are also personally important. While completing my undergraduate education, I performed research on drought-subjected chaparral vegetation in the Santa Monica mountains (more specifically, on members of the <i>Malosma laurina</i> community). Looking back, while this study was looking to understand the impact of climate change on the flora of the region, it also documented the botanical pain and grief associated with drought. Results exposed susceptibilities in health, changes in morphology, and the inability to function at a high capacity - much like the grief response in humans.
      </p>
      <p>
        While discussing this project with Professor Harpreet Sareen, he mentioned that one of his succulents had jumped out of its pot. It had grown in heaviness to the point that it fell to the countertop below. Harpreet mentioned that it looked like the succulent had committed suicide. What was weighing on this plant, besides its own biomass?
      </p>
      <p>
        At the risk of anthropomorphizing, I would like to explore this in greater detail. I would like to understand the connections between floral and faunal grieving practices in this final interaction project. Do trees exude the same weariness as those suffering a loss? As you read this statement, the plants around you may very well be communicating with you - speaking to you, experiencing your joy, crying out, or offering support in our collective grief.

      <h3>
        guiding questions
      </h3>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>How are plants represented in human grieving practices?</li>
          <li>How does plant behavior resemble human grief (note to self: beware of anthropomorphizing)?</li>
          <li>What changes in behavior do we observe in human-plant interaction? Why?</li>
          <li>How can organic materials or beings assist throughout different stages of the grieving process? What are the kinetic, olfactory, gustatory, visual, etc., signals and responses we can observe in both humans and plants?</li>
        </ol>

        How do green spaces impact public emotion? How do they support our mental, physical, and emotional health on an individual level? I walked through the community garden on Bleeker Street, through Washington Square Park, Central Park, Stuyvesant Square, and to the water on Pier 25 to investigate this.

        While walking around the city, I also observed a surprisingly large number of grasses and mosses growing in the sidewalks. These are plants that were not planted. They are plants that are sticking it to the man. Or maybe plants that just want to remind us that they exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        It piqued my interest: how are these plants able to grow, even when the conditions are less than ideal?

        My parents are both classical musicians, so music is central to their lives, as well as how they process emotion. When my mom's father passed away, she told me that she always listens to Richard Strauss's Four Last Songs when she loses someone. The music is incredibly beautiful and evocative of the end of life - I encourage you to listen to the recording with Elizabeth Schwarzkopf below.

      Ask about a detail within your inquiry, not the goal (e.g., instead of asking about animal adoption - goal - could you ask about the cultural bias around mixed-breed animals?). Don't seek validation or ask leading questions. Only gather information (Sareen 2021).

    <h2>next steps: embody through making</h2>
      <h3>drawing</h3>
      <p>
        I used visual techniques to generate ideas. After receiving feedback, I became particularly interested in understanding historic and current death practices for inspiration. When we combine the concepts of death practices with biodesign, what can we get? In addition to solutions for decay itself, can we create better healing spaces for those impacted by death?
      </p>
      <p>
        I took a deep dive into death and grieving practices, specifically within Eastern cultures (Chinese and Japanese traditions) and indigenous practices throughout the United States and Canada. This foundation informed my sketches.

<p>
  how do different species/objects contribute to the creation of space in terms of senses: sound/smell/ an atmosphere? The fact that you are thinking about death and grief and sustainability and decomposition is really so incorporative of the phases of grieving as well.

<h3>
  moving towards final form
</h3>
  <p>
    Based on the feedback from peers and the external reviewers, I identified two areas of this project that must be fleshed out: (1) what should <strong>collective</strong> grief processing look like, and (2) what forms will augment, rather than dim, this experience?
  </p>
  <p>
    Throughout the project, both peers and external reviewers consistently asked about whether this project, <i>emotocyte</i>, would be an installation to be experienced by one or by many. Many folks called attention to the fact that there are already grief practices in the collective and personal spheres of grief. The follow-up: where would <i>this</i> particular grief practice fit into that existing set of customs?
  </p>
  <p>
    To answer that, it’s important to locate the possible gaps in our current practices, or focus on grief in the particular context of 2020-2021. Maybe the question is not the general, “How do we help people grieve?”, but rather zooming in on, “How do we help people grieve when they are already grieving all the time? About a pandemic? The global condition? How do we help people find community in grief?”
