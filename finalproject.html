      <p>
        I am coming to this project with my own, very recent meditations on grief. Grief in both a global and personal sense. Recently, there have been many sources of grief and loneliness; last year, we saw the beginnings of the COVID-19 pandemic (within the US, it took over in March 2020) as well as manifestations of climate change and climate crisis. I have also lost close family members and friends over the past year. All of these events have contributed to my interest in manifestations of grief at different scales.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plant life and botany are also personally important. While completing my undergraduate education, I performed research on drought-subjected chaparral vegetation in the Santa Monica mountains (more specifically, on members of the <i>Malosma laurina</i> community). Looking back, while this study was looking to understand the impact of climate change on the flora of the region, it also documented the botanical pain and grief associated with drought. Results exposed susceptibilities in health, changes in morphology, and the inability to function at a high capacity - much like the grief response in humans.
      </p>

        While discussing this project with Professor Harpreet Sareen, he mentioned that one of his succulents had jumped out of its pot. It had grown in heaviness to the point that it fell to the countertop below. Harpreet mentioned that it looked like the succulent had committed suicide. What was weighing on this plant, besides its own biomass?
      </p>
      <p>
        At the risk of anthropomorphizing, I would like to explore this in greater detail. I would like to understand the connections between floral and faunal grieving practices in this final interaction project. Do trees exude the same weariness as those suffering a loss? As you read this statement, the plants around you may very well be communicating with you - speaking to you, experiencing your joy, crying out, or offering support in our collective grief.

      <h3>
        guiding questions
      </h3>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>How are plants represented in human grieving practices?</li>
          <li>How does plant behavior resemble human grief (note to self: beware of anthropomorphizing)?</li>
          <li>What changes in behavior do we observe in human-plant interaction? Why?</li>
          <li>How can organic materials or beings assist throughout different stages of the grieving process? What are the kinetic, olfactory, gustatory, visual, etc., signals and responses we can observe in both humans and plants?</li>
        </ol>
