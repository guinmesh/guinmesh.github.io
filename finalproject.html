        This page documents the final product of our interaction design studio. We were prompted to come up with our own areas of interest; once we had clarity in terms of this, we precipitated out specific research questions to explore further.

      <p>
        I have been meditating on grief, in both a global and personal sense. Recently, there have been many sources of grief and loneliness; last year, we saw the beginnings of the COVID-19 pandemic (within the US, it took over in March 2020) as well as manifestations of climate change and climate crisis. I have also lost close family members and friends over the past year. All of these events have contributed to my interest in manifestations of grief at different scales.
      </p>
     
      <p>
        Plant life and botany are also personally important. While completing my undergraduate education, I performed research on drought-subjected chaparral vegetation in the Santa Monica mountains (more specifically, on members of the <i>Malosma laurina</i> community). Looking back, while this study was looking to understand the impact of climate change on the flora of the region, it also documented the botanical pain and grief associated with drought. Results exposed susceptibilities in health, changes in morphology, and the inability to function at a high capacity - much like the grief response in humans.
      </p>
      <p>
        While discussing this project with Professor Harpreet Sareen, he mentioned that one of his succulents had jumped out of its pot. It had grown in heaviness to the point that it fell to the countertop below. Harpreet mentioned that it looked like the succulent had committed suicide. What was weighing on this plant, besides its own biomass?
      </p>
      <p>
        At the risk of anthropomorphizing, I would like to explore this in greater detail. I would like to understand the connections between floral and faunal grieving practices in this final interaction project. Do trees exude the same weariness as those suffering a loss? As you read this statement, the plants around you may very well be communicating with you - speaking to you, experiencing your joy, crying out, or offering support in our collective grief.

          <li>How does plant behavior resemble human grief (note to self: beware of anthropomorphizing)?</li>
          <li>What changes in behavior do we observe in human-plant interaction? Why?</li>
          <li>How can organic materials or beings assist throughout different stages of the grieving process? What are the kinetic, olfactory, gustatory, visual, etc., signals and responses we can observe in both humans and plants?</li>

        How do green spaces impact public emotion? How do they support our mental, physical, and emotional health on an individual level? I walked through the community garden on Bleeker Street, through Washington Square Park, Central Park, Stuyvesant Square, and to the water on Pier 25 to investigate this.

        While walking around the city, I also observed a surprisingly large number of grasses and mosses growing in the sidewalks. These are plants that were not planted. They are plants that are sticking it to the man. Or maybe plants that just want to remind us that they exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        It piqued my interest: how are these plants able to grow, even when the conditions are less than ideal?

        My parents are both classical musicians, so music is central to their lives, as well as how they process emotion. When my mom's father passed away, she told me that she always listens to Richard Strauss's Four Last Songs when she loses someone. The music is incredibly beautiful and evocative of the end of life - I encourage you to listen to the recording with Elizabeth Schwarzkopf below.

        I used visual techniques to generate ideas. After receiving feedback, I became particularly interested in understanding historic and current death practices for inspiration. When we combine the concepts of death practices with biodesign, what can we get? In addition to solutions for decay itself, can we create better healing spaces for those impacted by death?
      </p>
      <p>
        I took a deep dive into death and grieving practices, specifically within Eastern cultures (Chinese and Japanese traditions) and indigenous practices throughout the United States and Canada. This foundation informed my sketches.

  how do different species/objects contribute to the creation of space in terms of senses: sound/smell/ an atmosphere? The fact that you are thinking about death and grief and sustainability and decomposition is really so incorporative of the phases of grieving as well.

<h3>
  moving towards final form
</h3>
  <p>
    Based on the feedback from peers and the external reviewers, I identified two areas of this project that must be fleshed out: (1) what should <strong>collective</strong> grief processing look like, and (2) what forms will augment, rather than dim, this experience?
  </p>
  <p>
    Throughout the project, both peers and external reviewers consistently asked about whether this project, <i>emotocyte</i>, would be an installation to be experienced by one or by many. Many folks called attention to the fact that there are already grief practices in the collective and personal spheres of grief. The follow-up: where would <i>this</i> particular grief practice fit into that existing set of customs?
  </p>
  <p>
    To answer that, it’s important to locate the possible gaps in our current practices, or focus on grief in the particular context of 2020-2021. Maybe the question is not the general, “How do we help people grieve?”, but rather zooming in on the concept of assisting people through grief when they are already grieving all the time. This project is about personal grief, but it’s also about guiding someone through grief when their emotional cup is already overflowing. It’s about providing support. How could I help people find community in grief? If I could capture communion with loved ones, with strangers, and augment this with our existing relationships with plants, it would create a grieving niche of sorts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Following this realization, I found renewed inspiration towards the specific, very deliberate forms that could enhance a healing experience, one that is different from existing practices. Form must provide a clear directive for interaction, and the intended results should come out of those clear instructions naturally.
    </p>
<p><strong>How many subjects should this installation support at a time?</strong></p>
      <p>
        To focus on collective grieving, form should allow for multiple users at a time, but also quiet reflection. To this end, I’ll like to provide seating for 1-2 people within the installation, but make sure to provide an environment proximate to the installation that people can still contribute to.
      </p>
      <p>
        To that point, this installation must include clear, reflective tools (e.g., seed paper with prompts or without, open space for remembrance, pencils, pens, etc.). I think there is also importance in public vs. private reflection. I would like to include the option to hang memories on the installation, effectively creating a collective artwork by and for the community (public remembrance), as well as an option to physically bury memories (private).</p>
      <p>
        These two separate functionalities will require different tools. The public memories must somehow be hung, attached, and displayed on this installation. What would be a good way to do this? Can we somehow incorporate the plants, sustainable / biodegradable materials, etc.? For the private memories, seed paper, shovels, soil, and directions must be somehow provided.
      </p>
  <p>
    Another area that I'll need to dive into is the combination of culture and ecology in grieving practices. Many of my peers were left with questions about existing funeral rites, most specifically surrounding the actual species that are included as a part of different cultural grieving processes. Several folks mentioned festivals and practices honoring the dead, such as Dia de los Muertos (Rachel Gorman '23 - in in the Oaxacan context specifically), the QingMing festival in China (Ziyi (Skylar) Wang '23), Wabi-Sabi and Ikebana (Tricia Ilena '23), and many more. The further research I do in this sphere might help me refine the specific special forms and the particular "grief ecology" of my final piece.
  </p>
  <p>
    I plan to look into the biological and cultural similarity between the species typically employed in grief practice. Are there patterns to spot among these, even though grief practices span societies across the whole world? Even though there is ecological diversity with regards to location, there must be patterns in the types of organisms that are chosen for these traditions. For example, why flowers? Why the specific flowers that are chosen?
  </p>
  <p>
    Ultimately, after digging into what collective grief processing currently looks like, the moments and emotions that collective and personal grief processing may miss, and the forms that represent these two things, I will be able to begin prototyping and constructing my final piece. I want the directives and the goals to be incredibly clear in this project, because I think that will provide the most guided facilitation (of both emotion and concept).

<h3>
  day 1: paper model
</h3>
<p>
  Today, I created a paper model of a possibility for an installation. This model explored form, but, more importantly, it yielded observations about the connection between form and concept that were useful.
</p>
<div class="fullwidth">
  <img
  src="finalProject/assets/img-paperModel.jpg"
  alt="Paper model of seat with an awning, a guardrail, and a path. The seat has a cushion on the ground to its right."
  />
</div>
<p>
  There are a couple of key takeaways from this prototype. 
  <ol>
    <li>The prototype did a good job of communicating one intention: the visual instructions for a viewer to take a seat, or take a seat beside the installation.</li>
    <li>The prototype <strong>did not</strong> do a good job of communicating what this seat's intended use is. The imagery of the organic forms does not immediately communicate grief, or even healing. Further questions that must be addressed:
    <ul>
      <li>What is imagery that evokes grief and healing?</li>
      <li>What patterns are present in current grieving spaces?</li>
      <li>What is the gap that this project seeks to fill? Refine this again, and return to the answer throughout prototyping.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Who is this accessible to? More research into accessible furniture design necessary.</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<h3>
  day 2: wire model
</h3>
<p>
  Today, I created a wire prototype.
</p>
<div class="fullwidth">
  <img
  src="finalProject/assets/img-proto2.png"
  alt="Wire model of seat with a covering over it and a second seat to its right"
  />
</div>
<p>
  There are a couple of key takeaways from this prototype. 
  <ol>
    <li>The prototype again did a good job of communicating one intention: the visual instructions for a viewer to take a seat, or take a seat beside the installation.</li>
    <li>The prototype <strong>did not</strong> do a good job of communicating what this seat's intended use is. Still struggling with this. The imagery of the organic forms still does not immediately communicate grief.
  </ol>
</p>

<h3>
  day 3: wire model with foliage
</h3>
<p>
  In this model, I explored the use of greenery and texture. While I will continue to experiment with form, I wanted to see the way that the "organic" materials would interact with the wire frame.
</p>
<div class="fullwidth">
  <img
  src="finalProject/assets/img-proto3-1.png"
  alt="Wire model prototype with a green, foliage-like covering."
  />
</div>
<div class="fullwidth">
  <img
  src="finalProject/assets/img-proto3-2.png"
  alt="Close up of the interior of the wire model prototype with a green, foliage-like covering."
  />
</div>
<p>
  This prototype was satisfying in terms of the color palette, the textures I would like to include in the final piece, and the visual experience from within the prototype.
</p>

<h3>
  day 4: wire model with foliage
</h3>
<p>
  In this model, I worked with Photoshop to create a sense of what the structure would look like if people were interacting with it.  
</p>
<div class="fullwidth">
  <img
  src="finalProject/assets/img-proto3-1.png"
  alt="Wire model prototype with a green, foliage-like covering."

    <p>
      I am depressed, and I have experienced great loss. I would like to be less depressed. I would like to be able to process and understand and live with all of the parts of myself in a way that feels reflective, organic, and regenerative, not forced or antiseptic.
</p>
<p>Emotocyte is a project that, through existing relationships to nature and botany, will help process the profanity of loss, the role of community in healing, and the (sometimes lofty) expectations for social performance during emotional recovery.</p>

<p>Emotocyte reestablishes human sensory and emotional interaction with natural biological phenomena, while also connecting visitors to each other within a larger narrative about community grief. By creating an architectural installation, I hope to create a specific venue for this interaction to occur. The designated grieving space acts as a medium between physical and emotional planes. Emotocyte allows for directed emotional expression and reflection.</p>

<p>My intention for emotocyte is to help visitors process feelings of sadness, such as those produced by a significant loss or by other depressive events. The installation will invite viewers to stop, slow down, and listen to the senses. Elements of the installation will include visual, olfactory, auditory, and tactile elements (I have not yet found a way to incorporate taste and am still working to understand whether that would or would not fit into this experience).</p>

<p>My hope is that by creating an explicitly reflective, meditative space, this project will produce several reactions. Emotocyte will not only relieve stress through the experience, it will also create visibility into the experience - and utter normalcy! - of these painful emotions. After the global onslaught of grief caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, I view this process as even more necessary and explicit.</p>


--
<p>*It is important to note that I do not view this project as a replacement for other forms of psychological treatment or conventional, traditional grief practices, but rather as a supplement. I absolutely still endorse cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), psychiatry, group therapy, spiritual assistance, as well as funerary services, memorials, and other religious customs, like holding a shiva (in the Jewish faith) or a wake (in the Catholic faith). </p>

<p>Please don’t report me to student health! I am already in therapy, and I am experiencing much joy, pain, confusion, love, fear, anger, curiosity - I am having the complete human experience, so to speak.</p>

<p>
Here I am, living and learning about this very complex, very human life.
